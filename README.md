Comments:
InsertionSort.java is the same one that I turned in during Practice Assignment 4. MergeSort's getLeft and getRight functions use for-loops to copy in the array values, instead of Arrays.copyOfRange. The QuickSort function was provided by Professor Brizan, but I added in the swap function.
